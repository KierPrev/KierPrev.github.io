Hi! I'm Kiernan and I'm currently studying at [UNSL](http://unsl.edu.ar) to become a Licentiate in Physics. I completed a Music Production degree at the same institute previously.

I enjoy creation and analysis. It could be anything. A song that drives your emotions, a fictional world, an equation that describes reality.
