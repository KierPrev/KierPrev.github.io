Hi! I'm Kiernan and I'm currently studying at [UNSL](http://unsl.edu.ar) to become a Licentiate in Physics. I completed a Music Production degree at the same institute previously

I enjoy creation and analysis. It could be anything. A song that drives your emotions, a fictional world, an equation that describes reality

I love [upbeat jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfV9m2ereg), [random indie bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwDRU6LCV1M) and music in general

Feel free to [reach out](Contact)!
