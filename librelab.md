title: "LibreLab (2022)"
---

This project became into existence after a national program that promoted R&D projects inside the university

#### 🏁 Goal

Build experiments with the purpose to be used in schools and university lab classes

#### 👩‍💻 What were my responsibilities

- Design and build experiments suitable for lab classes
- Code on Arduino and test the hardware and sensors
- Write the necessary documentation to use the lab kit

#### 🛠️ What tools did I use

We developed code on the **Arduino** microchips. They use a variation of C++. On top of that, I made the [website](https://labunsl.github.io) in HTML, CSS, and Markdown, using Jekyll and GitHub pages.

#### 👥 Who were my co-workers

I worked with some fellow students and several teachers from the Department of Physics.
